    <h2>About This Hub</h2>

    <p>
      The Interactive Healthcare Hub is designed as a space where healthcare, research, and education meet. 
      The field of healthcare research is constantly evolving, driven by new challenges, emerging diseases, and 
      innovative technologies. In this hub, we focus on integrating evidence-based practices with digital 
      solutions that make care more efficient, equitable, and accessible. For example, digital health platforms 
      allow patients in rural areas to connect with specialists in urban hospitals. At the same time, data-driven 
      insights support healthcare leaders in making better decisions about resource allocation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This hub is not just about technology but also about empowerment. We believe that research is only 
      meaningful when it is applied, and education is only powerful when it is accessible. Therefore, this 
      platform aims to train community health workers, empower patients, and guide policy makers through 
      interactive resources. As you explore, you‚Äôll find tools, games, and insights designed to make learning 
      engaging. We want you to walk away not just informed, but inspired to contribute to the advancement of 
      healthcare in your community and beyond.

    <h3>Founding Story</h3>
    <p>
      NextGen Health Systems was founded by <strong>Pauline Mwenje</strong>, who saw the gaps in community health systems 
      during her career in public health and project management. Determined to bridge these gaps, she 
      established the platform with a focus on evidence, innovation, and empowerment. 
      She partnered with <strong>Jones Obure</strong>, who now serves as Advisor and CEO, bringing his 
      wealth of experience in leadership and organizational growth. Together, they created a team 
      committed to advancing healthcare solutions that matter.
